# Pomodoro Timer

Day 28 project of the 100days of code challenge. It's a Pomodoro Timer built using Tkinter, a Python GUI toolkit.

Description

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The Pomodoro Timer application allows you to set custom work and break intervals and helps you stay productive by keeping track of your work and break periods.

## Features

+ Set custom work and break intervals.
+ Visual countdown timer with a tomato image.
+ Display of the current timer status (work or break).
+ Reset functionality to start a new Pomodoro session.


## Requirements

+ Python 3.x
+ Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)


## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

``python pomodoro_timer.py``
+ Enter the desired work interval duration in minutes in the input field.
+ Click the **"Start"** button to begin the Pomodoro session.
+ The timer will count down the work interval duration. When the work interval is complete, a break interval will start automatically.
+ The timer status will change to "Break" during break intervals.
+ Click the **"Reset"** button to stop the current Pomodoro session and start a new one.
